  <summary>short bio</summary>

  If you're reading this, then you just wanna know the PonyTown info. C+H is fine, and W2I is encouraged so I can see any messages.
  My style in pony skins changes a lot, so I recommend identifying me by my github.
  I always main the safe server, so feel free to interact. I know my rentry is strict for under 16 individuals, but that was more so for outside of PonyTown platforms.
  Anyone interact.
